## Improvement proposals

  * [ ] Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to follow [coding conventions](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
  * [ ] Use [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger) to visualize Redux actions/reducers & quickly debug via Javascript console.
  * [ ] Use [redux-axios-middleware](https://github.com/svrcekmichal/redux-axios-middleware) & [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to make conventional API requests.
  * [ ] Use [react-native-joi](https://github.com/GoldenOwlAsia/react-native-joi) to contruct data model system with strong schema validation.
  * [ ] Use [App Center](https://appcenter.ms) to provide comprehensive solutions for internal tests delivery & CodePush for Javascript OTA update.
  * [ ] Use [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) to automate app building (for both iOS & Android).
